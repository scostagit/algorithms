Sure! Let’s break this down into simple English.

### 💡 What is a Stack Algorithm?

A **stack** is like a stack of plates 🍽️:

* You **add** a plate to the **top** — this is called `push`.
* You **remove** the top plate — this is called `pop`.

A stack follows the rule:
**Last In, First Out** (LIFO)
👉 The last item you put in is the first one to come out.

### 📏 What is Big O Notation?

**Big O** tells us **how fast** (or **slow**) an algorithm is as the input gets **bigger**.

For example:

* `O(1)` → super fast, no matter how big the input is.
* `O(n)` → gets slower as input grows.
* `O(n^2)` → even slower (bad for large input).

It helps us compare which code is **better** for performance.

### 🧑‍💻 Simple Stack in Pure JavaScript

Here’s a simple example:

```javascript
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = []; // The stack
  }

  // Add item to the stack (O(1))
  push(item) {
    this.items.push(item);
  }

  // Remove item from the stack (O(1))
  pop() {
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  // See the top item (O(1))
  peek() {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }

  // Check if it's empty (O(1))
  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }
}

// Example use
const myStack = new Stack();
myStack.push(10);
myStack.push(20);
console.log(myStack.pop());   // 20
console.log(myStack.peek());  // 10
```

### Summary:

* **Stack** = Like plates: Last in, First out.i
* **Big O** = Way to describe how fast a function runs.
* Common stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`) are usually `O(1)` (very fast).

Want an example of a real-world use case of stacks (like browser back buttons or undo features)?
