### 🧠 What is the **Sliding Window** algorithm?

**In simple words:**

Imagine you are looking at a long row of numbers.
Now you want to look at **only a few numbers at a time**, like looking through a small window.

You move this **window** step by step from left to right, checking what's inside it.

This helps you **save time**, because you don’t have to check the whole list again and again.

---

### 👶 Example Problem:

**Find the biggest number in every group of 3 numbers** in this list:

```js
[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
```

So, the window size is `3`.
We move the window across the list, one step at a time.

---

### 👨‍💻 Simple JavaScript Code

```js
let nums = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4];  // our number list
let k = 3;                   // window size (we look at 3 numbers at a time)

for (let i = 0; i <= nums.length - k; i++) {
  // get 3 numbers starting from position i
  let window = nums.slice(i, i + k);  

  // find the biggest number in this small window
  let max = Math.max(...window);      

  // show the result
  console.log("Window:", window, "→ Max:", max); 
}
```

---

### 💬 What does the code do?

1. We loop from the start of the array to the point where a full window of size `k` can fit.
2. `slice(i, i + k)` gets a part of the array, like a small window.
3. `Math.max(...window)` finds the biggest number inside that window.
4. `console.log` shows the result.

---

### 🧪 Output of this code:

```
Window: [ 1, 3, 2 ] → Max: 3
Window: [ 3, 2, 5 ] → Max: 5
Window: [ 2, 5, 4 ] → Max: 5
```
