Sure! Let me explain the **3Sum algorithm** in **simple English**, and then I’ll show you how to implement it.

---

## 🧠 **What is the 3Sum problem?**

You are given an array of numbers.

You need to find **all unique sets of 3 numbers** from the array that **add up to zero**.

Each set must have **3 different numbers** from **different positions** in the array. And **no duplicate sets** are allowed.

---

## 🔍 Example:

```js
Input: [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]

Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

### Why?

Look at these combinations:

* `-1 + 0 + 1 = 0` ✅
* `-1 + -1 + 2 = 0` ✅

These are the **only** unique sets that work.
Others either don’t add to zero or are duplicates.

---

## 🧰 How do we solve this?

Here's the basic idea step by step:

### 1. **Sort the array**

Makes it easier to avoid duplicates and use two pointers.

```js
nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

### 2. **Loop through each number in the array**

We'll fix one number (`nums[i]`) and try to find two other numbers that make the sum zero.

### 3. **Use two pointers**

* One pointer starts from the left (`left`)
* One pointer starts from the right (`right`)
* Move the pointers inward depending on the sum

### 4. **Skip duplicates**

To avoid adding the same triplet again.

## ✅ Here's the full code with comments:

```js
var threeSum = function(nums) {
    let result = [];

    // Step 1: Sort the array
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Step 2: Go through each number
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
        // Skip duplicate numbers
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;

        let left = i + 1;
        let right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            let sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];

            if (sum === 0) {
                // Found a triplet
                result.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);

                // Skip duplicate numbers for left and right
                while (nums[left] === nums[left + 1]) left++;
                while (nums[right] === nums[right - 1]) right--;

                // Move both pointers
                left++;
                right--;
            } else if (sum < 0) {
                // Sum is too small, move left pointer
                left++;
            } else {
                // Sum is too big, move right pointer
                right--;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

---

## 🧪 Test it:

```js
console.log(threeSum([-1,0,1,2,-1,-4])); // [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
console.log(threeSum([0,1,1])); // []
console.log(threeSum([0,0,0])); // [[0,0,0]]
```

---

## 📝 Summary (in very simple words):

* Sort the list.
* Pick one number.
* Use two fingers (pointers) to find two more numbers that make the sum zero.
* Be careful to **not repeat** the same group of numbers.




Great! Let's walk through a **visual explanation** of the 3Sum algorithm step by step using a simple example:

---

## 🎯 Example Input:

```js
[-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
```

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Sort the array

```js
[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]
```

This makes it easier to find combinations and skip duplicates.

---

## 🔁 Step 2: Loop through the array

We'll go one number at a time, and for each one, we try to find two more numbers to make the sum 0.

Let’s look at the loop visually:

---

### 🔍 First loop (i = 0):

* `nums[i] = -4`
* We want to find **two numbers** such that:
  `-4 + left + right = 0`
  ➤ So we need: `left + right = 4`

#### Pointers:

```
i    left         right
↓     ↓             ↓
[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]
```

#### Try 1:

* `-1 + 2 = 1` → too small → move left to next

#### Try 2:

* `-1 + 1 = 0` → too small → move left again

#### Try 3:

* `0 + 1 = 1` → too small → move left again

No pair found ➤ move to next `i`

---

### 🔍 Second loop (i = 1):

* `nums[i] = -1`
* We want: `left + right = 1`

#### Pointers:

```
     i     left         right
     ↓      ↓             ↓
[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]
```

#### Try 1:

* `-1 + 2 = 1` → ✅ FOUND: `[-1, -1, 2]`

**Skip duplicates** and move pointers:

#### Try 2:

```
     i         left     right
     ↓          ↓        ↓
[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]
```

* `0 + 1 = 1` → ✅ FOUND: `[-1, 0, 1]`

Nothing else ➤ move to next `i`

---

### 🔍 Third loop (i = 2):

* `nums[i] = -1` again ➤ **Skip** (we already used -1)

---

### 🔍 Fourth loop (i = 3):

* `nums[i] = 0`
* Need: `left + right = 0`

#### Pointers:

```
               i     left     right
               ↓      ↓        ↓
[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]
```

* `1 + 2 = 3` → too big → move right leftward

Nothing found ➤ move on

---

### ✅ Final Result:

```js
[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

## 🎨 Want a sketch-like diagram?

Here’s a **text-style visual** of how the pointers move:

```
Sorted: [-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]

i = -4   →    Try -1 + 2 → Too small
             Try  0 + 2 → Too small

i = -1   →    Try -1 + 2 → -1 + -1 + 2 = 0 ✅
             Try  0 + 1 → -1 + 0 + 1 = 0 ✅

i =  0   →    Try 1 + 2  → Too big

Done!
```

I can create a simple visual chart showing how the pointers move at each step.

# Why nums.length -2?


Great question!

You're asking:

> **"Why do we have `nums.length - 2` in the line `for(let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++)`?"**

### 🔍 Short Answer:

Because we are looking for **three numbers** (`nums[i]`, `nums[left]`, and `nums[right]`) that sum to zero — and we need at least **two numbers after `i`** to form a valid triplet. So the loop should stop when there are **only two or fewer elements left** to check.

---

### 👇 Longer Explanation:

The loop:

```js
for(let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++)
```

ensures that the `i` pointer never goes so far that there aren't at least two more elements available to use as `left` and `right`.

Let’s break it down:

* You're iterating through the array with index `i`.
* For each `i`, you set:

  ```js
  let left = i + 1;
  let right = nums.length - 1;
  ```
* So you need `left` and `right` to be **valid indices**, and `left` must be less than `right`.

If you let `i` go up to `nums.length - 1` or `nums.length - 2`, you'd end up with:

* `left = i + 1` being equal to or **beyond the array bounds**
* Not enough elements to form a triplet

### 📌 Example:

Say `nums.length === 6`. Valid values for `i` are:

* `i = 0 → left = 1 → right = 5 ✅`
* `i = 1 → left = 2 → right = 5 ✅`
* `i = 3 → left = 4 → right = 5 ✅`
* `i = 4 → left = 5 → right = 5 ❌` → `left === right`
* `i = 5 → left = 6 → out of bounds ❌`

So the **last valid index for `i` is `nums.length - 3`**, and therefore:

```js
i < nums.length - 2
```

---

### ⚠️ Also: There's a small bug in your current code

This line is wrong:

```js
let right = nums.length;
```

It should be:

```js
let right = nums.length - 1;
```

Otherwise `nums[right]` will be `undefined`, because `nums.length` is **outside** the array.

---

### ✅ Corrected loop:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
  if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;

  let left = i + 1;
  let right = nums.length - 1; // <-- fixed this

  while (left < right) {
    let sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (sum === 0) {
      result.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);

      while (nums[left] === nums[left + 1]) left++;
      while (nums[right] === nums[right - 1]) right--;

      left++;
      right--;
    } else if (sum < 0) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }
}
```
