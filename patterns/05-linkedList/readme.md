Sure! Let’s break it down in **simple English** first.

### 🧠 What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a way to store a list of items in programming.
Think of it like a **chain** where each link (called a "node") holds:

1. **Data** (like a number or name)
2. A **pointer** (or link) to the **next node** in the chain

Unlike an array, the items are not next to each other in memory. Instead, each item tells where the next one is.

#### 🔗 Example:

```
[1] → [2] → [3] → null
```

* Each box is a node.
* The arrow shows the connection to the next node.
* `null` means it's the end of the list.

### 📏 What is Big O Notation?

**Big O notation** is a way to describe how **fast** or **slow** an algorithm is as the list grows.

Here are some common ones:

* `O(1)` → Super fast! Constant time (no matter how big the list is).
* `O(n)` → Slower. Grows with the size of the list.
* `O(n^2)` → Even slower (used in things like nested loops).

### 🧑‍💻 Simple Linked List in Pure JavaScript

Here's a basic version of a singly linked list:

```javascript
// Define a Node
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;  // The data
    this.next = null;    // The link to the next node
  }
}

// Define the LinkedList
class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null; // Start with an empty list
  }

  // Add a new value to the end of the list
  append(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = newNode; // First node in the list
      return;
    }

    let current = this.head;
    while (current.next) {
      current = current.next;
    }

    current.next = newNode; // Add to the end
  }

  // Print all values
  print() {
    let current = this.head;
    while (current) {
      console.log(current.value);
      current = current.next;
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const list = new LinkedList();
list.append(10);
list.append(20);
list.append(30);
list.print(); // Output: 10, 20, 30
```

### ⚡ Big O of Linked List Operations

| Operation    | Big O  |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Add at end   | `O(n)` |
| Add at start | `O(1)` |
| Search value | `O(n)` |
| Delete value | `O(n)` |

Let me know if you want an example with **removing**, **searching**, or a **doubly linked list** (nodes link both ways).
