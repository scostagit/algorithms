## 🥞 What is a Stack?

Think of a **stack** like a **pile of plates**:

* You can **only add** a plate to the **top**.
* You can **only take** a plate from the **top**.
* The last plate you put is the **first one** you take.

This is called **LIFO**: **Last In, First Out**.

## 👀 Why Use a Stack in This Problem?

We want to know for each day:

> "How many days do I have to wait for a warmer day?"

This is hard to answer immediately because we don’t know the future yet!

So, we use a stack to **save the days** we need to come back to **later**, when we **see a warmer temperature**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Step by Step)

Imagine the input:

```js
temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
```

We go day by day:

### Day 0: 73°F

* We don’t know the future → put index `0` on the stack
  📥 Stack: `[0]`

---

### Day 1: 74°F

* 74 > 73 → warmer than the day on top of the stack (day 0)
* So, day 0 waits **1 day** → answer[0] = 1
* Remove (pop) day 0 from stack
  📥 Stack: `[]`
* Add day 1 → 📥 Stack: `[1]`

---

### Day 2: 75°F

* 75 > 74 → warmer than day 1
* Day 1 waits **1 day** → answer[1] = 1
* Pop day 1 → Stack: `[]`
* Add day 2 → Stack: `[2]`

---

### Day 3: 71°F

* 71 is **not warmer** than 75 (day 2) → Can’t answer yet
* Add day 3 → Stack: `[2, 3]`

---

### Day 4: 69°F

* 69 is **not warmer** than 71 → wait again
* Add day 4 → Stack: `[2, 3, 4]`

---

### Day 5: 72°F

* 72 > 69 → answer[4] = 1 → pop day 4
* 72 > 71 → answer[3] = 2 → pop day 3
* Add day 5 → Stack: `[2, 5]`

---

### Day 6: 76°F

* 76 > 72 → answer[5] = 1 → pop day 5
* 76 > 75 → answer[2] = 4 → pop day 2
* Add day 6 → Stack: `[6]`

---

### Day 7: 73°F

* 73 is not warmer than 76 → add to stack
  Stack: `[6, 7]`

---

## ✅ Why Is This Efficient?

### 🔁 Brute Force (Bad Way)

You check every day against **all future days** → very slow:
**O(n²)** time (n = number of days)

### ✅ Stack (Smart Way)

You only look at each day **once**, and maybe pop it once.
Much faster → **O(n)** time

Because:

* Each day goes on the stack only once
* Each day comes off only once

---

## 💡 Final Thoughts

**The stack helps us:**

* Keep track of **days we don’t have answers for yet**
* **Quickly update** them when we find a warmer day
* Avoid checking every day again and again

# Brute force

What is Brute Force?

In the brute-force way, we check every day against all the days after it to find a warmer temperature.

It is simple to understand, but slow for big inputs.

```javascript

var dailyTemperatures = function(temperatures) {
    // Create an array with the same length, filled with 0
    let result = new Array(temperatures.length).fill(0);

    // Loop through each day (i)
    for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
        // Check every day after day i (j)
        for (let j = i + 1; j < temperatures.length; j++) {
            // If we find a warmer day
            if (temperatures[j] > temperatures[i]) {
                // Save how many days we had to wait
                result[i] = j - i;
                // Stop checking more days
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the result array
    return result;
};

```
