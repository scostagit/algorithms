Could you clarify exactly what you mean by  HankRanker C# and React test”? Do you mean:

1. A coding/test assignment that bozo uses (for a HankRanker product) involving C# (backend) + React (frontend)?
2. You want help preparing for a test involving C# and React used by a company named bozo / HankRanker?
3. You already have a test (questions, code) and you want help solving it?

In the meantime, here are general tips + sample structure for a combined C# + React test, and what they might assess:

---

## What such a test might include

A full-stack test involving C# (likely ASP.NET or .NET Core) and React often covers:

### Backend (C#/.NET)

* Building REST APIs (CRUD operations)
* Data modeling / DTOs / Entity Framework or ORM usage
* Dependency injection
* Unit testing services/controllers (using xUnit, NUnit, MSTest)
* Mocking dependencies (e.g. with Moq)
* Validation, error handling, status codes
* Authentication/authorization (if relevant)
* Integration tests or end-to-end tests (WebApplicationFactory etc.)

### Frontend (React)

* Component structure (functional components, class components)
* State and props
* Hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
* Fetching data from API (e.g. via `fetch`, `axios`)
* Error / loading states
* Form handling and validation
* UI updates / re-renders
* Possibly routing (React Router)
* Unit / integration testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
* Mocking API calls (msw or jest mocks)

### Integration / Full system

* How frontend and backend communicate
* End-to-end flow: e.g. user fills a form, hits API, backend stores data, frontend displays it
* Error cases (backend error, invalid input, network failure)
* Performance / optimization (caching, minimizing re-renders)

## Sample structure for a test or assignment

Here’s a toy version of what an assignment/test could look like:

> You are to build a simple “Ranking” app.
>
> * Backend: using ASP.NET Core, create endpoints to:
>
>   1. Create a “Ranking” record (e.g. name + score)
>   2. List all rankings sorted by score
>   3. Update a ranking
>   4. Delete a ranking
> * Frontend: Using React:
>
>   1. Display the list of rankings
>   2. Allow adding a new ranking
>   3. Allow editing or deleting
>   4. Show loading / error states
>   5. Use React hooks & functional components
> * Testing:
>
>   1. On backend, write unit tests for the service logic / controller
>   2. On frontend, write tests for components (e.g. “AddRanking” form, “RankingList”)
>   3. Mock the API calls for frontend tests

You may be asked to hand in code, or demonstrate via a live coding exercise.

## Tips for doing well

* Keep your code modular: separate service logic from controllers, separate API calls from UI logic
* Use interfaces and dependency injection so you can mock easily in tests
* In React tests, don’t test implementation detail; test user behavior and output
* Mock API calls in frontend tests (so you don’t depend on a real backend)
* Handle error and edge cases (empty list, network failure, input validation)
* Ensure your tests are fast and deterministic
* Clean up resources in tests (dispose, use `afterEach`)
* Write meaningful assertions

If you send me the actual test or question prompts (or sample code) that you're working on, I can help you with detailed solutions (backend + frontend) for that specific test. Do you want me to draft a full sample test + solution in C# + React for you now, as a practice?
