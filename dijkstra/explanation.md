Sure! Here's a simple, step-by-step explanation of the algorithm you posted, using **easy English**:

### üó∫Ô∏è What the code does:
This code **finds the shortest path** from one place (like `A`) to another place (like `D`) in a small map (called a **graph**). It also tells us **how long** that path is.

---

### üî¢ What is the graph?

```javascript
const graph = {
    A: { B: 1, C: 4 },
    B: { D: 2 },
    C: { D: 3 },
    D: {}
};
```

- A can go to B (cost 1) or C (cost 4)
- B can go to D (cost 2)
- C can go to D (cost 3)
- D goes nowhere

### üß† How the algorithm works (step-by-step):

1. **Create empty tracking tools:**
   - `distance`: keeps the shortest distance from the start to every point
   - `visited`: remembers which places we've already looked at
   - `previous`: remembers how we got to each place
   - `nodes`: a list of all places we still need to check

2. **Set starting distances:**
   - All places start with distance = Infinity (we don‚Äôt know how far they are)
   - The starting place (e.g., A) is set to 0 (you‚Äôre already there)

3. **Start checking nodes:**
   - While there are still places to check:
     - Find the place with the **smallest distance** that hasn‚Äôt been visited yet
     - If there is no such place, we stop
     - Mark it as **visited**
     - If it‚Äôs the destination, we stop

4. **Look at neighbors:**
   - For each place you can go from the current one:
     - If we haven‚Äôt visited it:
       - Add the current distance + the cost to go there
       - If that total is **less than** the known distance, update it
       - Also remember that we got there from the current place

5. **Remove the current place from the list** (`nodes.splice(...)`):
   - So we don‚Äôt check it again

6. **Rebuild the path:**
   - Start from the destination (like D)
   - Look in `previous` to see where you came from
   - Keep going back and adding to the path
   - Use `unshift()` to build the path in the right order

7. **Return the result:**
   - `distance`: how far every place is from the start
   - `path`: the shortest path from start to end

### üßæ Example Output:
```plaintext
Shortest distance: { A: 0, B: 1, C: 4, D: 3 }
Path: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí D
```

This means:
- The shortest path from A to D is **A ‚Üí B ‚Üí D**
- The total cost is **3** (A‚ÜíB = 1, B‚ÜíD = 2)
