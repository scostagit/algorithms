Sure! Let's break down the time complexity of your recursive factorial function in simple terms.

### üßÆ What Does the Function Do?

Your function calculates the factorial of a number $n$. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to that number. For example:

* $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$

In your function:

* If $n = 0$, it returns 1 (since $0! = 1$).
* If $n > 0$, it returns $n \times \text{factorial}(n - 1)$

This means the function calls itself with a smaller number each time until it reaches 0.

### ‚è±Ô∏è How Long Does It Take? (Time Complexity)

* Each time the function calls itself, it reduces $n$ by 1.
* So, to reach 0 from $n$, it makes $n$ calls.
* Each call does a small amount of work (just a multiplication).

Therefore, the total time it takes is proportional to $n$, which we write as **O(n)**.([Taro][1])

### üß† How Much Memory Does It Use? (Space Complexity)

* Each time the function calls itself, it adds a new layer to the call stack (a kind of memory used to keep track of function calls).
* Since there are $n$ calls, the call stack grows to size $n$.

Therefore, the memory used is also proportional to $n$, which we write as **O(n)**.

### üîÑ What If We Used a Loop Instead?

If we used a loop to calculate the factorial, we wouldn't need to make multiple function calls. Instead, we'd just repeat the multiplication process in a single function.

* This would still take **O(n)** time (since we still multiply $n$ times).
* But it would only use **O(1)** space, because we wouldn't need extra memory for function calls.

So, using a loop can be more efficient in terms of memory.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* Your recursive factorial function takes **O(n)** time and uses **O(n)** space.
* An iterative (loop-based) version would also take **O(n)** time but only **O(1)** space.

For small numbers, both methods work fine. But for larger numbers, the iterative method is usually better because it uses less memory.
