The problem you're dealing with is to **compute the maximal network rank** in a graph defined by cities and bidirectional roads. Let's break this down into understandable parts and explain the **logic** of the algorithm you'll need — without providing the exact code.

### 🧠 **Key Concepts**

* **Cities**: Represented by numbers from `1` to `N`.
* **Roads**: Given by two arrays `A` and `B`, where `A[i]` and `B[i]` are the cities connected by the `i-th` road.
* **Network Rank**: For any two distinct cities `i` and `j`, their **network rank** is the **total number of roads connected to either city**, **counting shared roads only once**.

---

### 🪜 **Algorithm Steps and Logic**

1. **Initialize Road Counts**

   * Use an array `degree[]` of size `N + 1` (since cities are numbered from 1 to N) to keep track of how many roads each city is involved in.
   * Traverse arrays `A` and `B`, and for every road:

     * Increment the road count for both `A[i]` and `B[i]`.

2. **Track Direct Connections**

   * Use a `Set` or a 2D map to store pairs of directly connected cities.
   * This is needed to **avoid double counting** when computing the network rank for directly connected cities.

3. **Compute Max Network Rank**

   * For every **pair of distinct cities** `(i, j)`:

     * Calculate their network rank: `degree[i] + degree[j]`
     * If `i` and `j` are **directly connected**, subtract 1 (because the shared road was counted twice).
     * Keep track of the **maximum** network rank seen.

### 💡 Optimizations (Efficiency Tips)

* Since N is at most 100, checking **all pairs (i, j)** is acceptable — O(N²) is manageable.
* Storing direct connections in a `Set` using a string format like `"i#j"` or using a boolean 2D array can speed up the check for direct connections.

### 🧮 Example Walkthrough (Visually)

For example:

* A = \[1, 2, 3, 3]
* B = \[2, 3, 1, 4]
* N = 4

You count:

* City 1 is in 2 roads: (1–2), (1–3)
* City 2 is in 2 roads: (1–2), (2–3)
* City 3 is in 3 roads: (2–3), (1–3), (3–4)
* City 4 is in 1 road: (3–4)

For cities 2 and 3:

* Network rank = 2 (from city 2) + 3 (from city 3) = 5
* Subtract 1 if directly connected → Result = 4

Great question! Let's walk through the code **line by line with comments**, and I'll explain **exactly why we subtract 1** in certain cases.

### 🧠 Key Reminder:

The **network rank** between two cities is:

> Total number of roads connected to either of the two cities.

If the two cities are **directly connected by a road**, then that road would be **counted twice** (once for each city), so we subtract 1 to avoid **double counting**.

### 📜 Code with Line-by-Line Comments

```javascript
function solution(A, B, N) {
    // Step 1: Count number of roads connected to each city
    const degree = Array(N + 1).fill(0); 
    // Creates an array of size N+1 (since cities are 1-indexed), filled with 0s.
    // degree[i] will store how many roads are connected to city i.

    for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        degree[A[i]]++; // City A[i] has one more road
        degree[B[i]]++; // City B[i] has one more road
    }

    // Step 2: Store direct connections between cities using a plain object
    const connected = {}; 
    // We'll store key-value pairs like "1-2": true to mark direct roads.

    for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        const key1 = A[i] + '-' + B[i]; // e.g. "1-2"
        const key2 = B[i] + '-' + A[i]; // e.g. "2-1"
        connected[key1] = true; // mark cities as directly connected
        connected[key2] = true; // make sure we can look up either way
    }

    // Step 3: Try all city pairs to find the max network rank
    let maxRank = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j <= N; j++) {
            // calculate the total number of roads connected to city i and j
            let rank = degree[i] + degree[j];

            // If cities i and j are directly connected by a road, we counted that road twice.
            // So subtract 1 to avoid double-counting.
            if (connected[i + '-' + j]) {
                rank--; // subtract 1 because that one road is shared
            }

            // Update max rank if this pair gives a higher value
            maxRank = Math.max(maxRank, rank);
        }
    }

    return maxRank; // return the highest network rank found
}
```

### 🔁 Why Subtract 1?

Let’s take an example:

* Suppose city 2 has 2 roads and city 3 has 3 roads.
* So, `degree[2] + degree[3] = 5`.

Now imagine there’s **a direct road** between city 2 and city 3. That road is counted:

* Once in `degree[2]`
* Once in `degree[3]`

But it’s **only one road**, so to get the **correct number of unique roads**, we must subtract **1** from the total.
